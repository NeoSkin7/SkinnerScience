            Particle Emitter
        </h3>
        <p>
            The particle emitter emits particles. It does this because it most commonly holds an unstable element or
            isotope that emits particles due to radioactive decay.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Oscillator
        </h3>
        <p>
            Due to the fact that mains power is supplied as direct current (DC), an oscillator is required to to create
            an alternating currect (AC).

            Electrode

            The electrodes that work as electromagnets due to the polarity of the current running through them.

            How it Works
        </h2>
        <p>
            A positive or negative particle is emitted due to alpha (α) and beta (β) radiation. In the case of alpha, a
            helion (2 protons and 2 neutrons) is released and in the case of beta radiation, a neutron is split into a
            proton, electron, and electron antineutrino or a proton is split into a neutron, positron, and electron
            neutrino. In the case of beta radiation, only the lighter particles are emitted (electron, positron, and
            neutrinos) although scientists can alter the emitter to only release one specific particle of the four
            available. These released particles have an overall charge that is either positive or negative and as such
            can be attracted or repelled by the electrodes. It accelerates particles by having two electrodes - one with
            the opposite charge in the direction the particles need to travel to attract the particles forwards and one
            with the same charge as the particles behind them to repel them forwards. When it reaches the attracting
            electrode, the polarities reverse and the same effect occurs again, this makes the particles accelerate
            forwards enabling scientists to take readings.
