                    This website aims to provide the world with accurate, detailed data from across the three
                    disciplines of science, give students and teachers alike factually correct descriptions of many
                    scientific concepts, and aid teachers in their teaching of the world around us.

                    History

                <p>
                    In October 2021, a periodic table was created by this website&apos;s author, Neo Skinner, this
                    periodic table then raised interest in a scientific datasheets project which aims to create 8
                    scientifically accurate datasheets accross Chemistry and Physics. In late November 2021, this
                    website was created as a means to enable the project to reach the general project. You can view all
                    of the datasheets in their current form <a href="../datasheets/" class="inline-link">here</a>.

                    as possible and all of our wiki articles are regularly fact-checked and rewritten to accomodate
                    recent advancements in science. Much of the data and articles have been written/created by me
                    personally, so if you wish to confirm their accuracy at any point, just drop me a line in the
                    contact section (far right), and I&apos;ll get in touch as soon as I can.

                    package is copyright Neo L. Skinner and the SkinnerScience team. The authors hope you enjoy using
                    SkinnerScience and find it useful. The authors endeavours to ensure that the information within
                    SkinnerScience is high quality but you and I both have to accept there are still plenty of errors -
                    the team do really try their best. Copyright to some data (indicated on the appropriate pages)
                    resides with those who compiled that data and I am most grateful to a number of people whose names
                    are indicated on the appropriate pages who gave permission for some of their data to be published in
                    SkinnerScience.

                    the data you find in SkinnerScience. Many errors and problems have been reported to me and time
                    permitting, I&apos;m still working on them. Do please keep the error reports coming in!
