                <p>
                    This website aims to provide the world with accurate, detailed data from across the three
                    disciplines of science, give students and teachers alike factually correct descriptions of many
                    scientific concepts, and aid teachers in their teaching of the world around us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In October 2021, a periodic table was created by this website&apos;s author, Neo Skinner, this
                    periodic table then raised interest in a scientific datasheets project which aims to create 8
                    scientifically accurate datasheets accross Chemistry and Physics. In late November 2021, this
                    website was created as a means to enable the project to reach the general project. You can view all
                    of the datasheets in their current form <a href="../datasheets/" class="inline-link">here</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Author&apos;s Note
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope you find this website helpful and informative, the information and data is kept as up-to-date
                    as possible and all of our wiki articles are regularly fact-checked and rewritten to accomodate
                    recent advancements in science. Much of the data and articles have been written/created by me
                    personally, so if you wish to confirm their accuracy at any point, just drop me a line in the
                    contact section (far right), and I&apos;ll get in touch as soon as I can.
